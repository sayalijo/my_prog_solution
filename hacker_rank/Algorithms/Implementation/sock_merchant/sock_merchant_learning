My solution:
	return sum([ar.count(i)//2 for i in set(ar)])

Comment on Discussion forum:
	Unfortunately, I think this is O(n^2). Not that it matters too much for a problem with 100 socks.
	The issue is that set(socks) is of size O(n) and list.count() method's runtime is O(n)

Conclusion: 
	Use Counter.

New code:
	def sockMerchant(n, ar):
    		pairs = 0
    		freq = Counter(ar)
    		for sock in freq:
        		pairs += freq[sock] // 2
    		return pairs
